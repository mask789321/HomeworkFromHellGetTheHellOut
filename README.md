Release notes:
Full Release ||
This upload is the full game, with working menus, enemies, collisions, textures, art, models, etc. From the prototype, we've retained the level design and the general movement, and the pen locations. The final notebook collectable was added in this release, as well as the music. The game now features two different enemy types: the demon, walking in a set path, and the spirit, chasing the player. Additional lighting and art was also placed in the game, and we made a new model for the demon.


Prototype Release ||
This upload contains the gameplay prototype and the art prototype. The gameplay prototype has our working movement system, interactable collectables, and an enemy that follows the player if they are within range. It also contains placeholder music and basic lighting. 

The art prototype has our player model, two enemy models (Spirit and Devil), our floor and wall textures, and our pen collectable.
