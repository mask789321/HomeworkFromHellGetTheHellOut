This upload contains the gameplay prototype and the art prototype. The gameplay prototype has our working movement system, interactable collectables, and an enemy that follows the player if they are within range. It also contains placeholder music and basic lighting. 

The art prototype has our player model, two enemy models (Spirit and Devil), our floor and wall textures, and our pen collectable.
